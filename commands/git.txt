there are two ways you can make a git repository on your computer

	1. you can do git clone <repourl>

	2. you can make a folder and you can do this command

		git init

			git init or git clone make a .git folder - it's hidden so the only way you can see it is if you do

				ls -la

git branch
	shows the branches you have


$ git remote -v

	shows you any cloud repositories that are connected to your local repository

$ git remote add origin git@github.com:katpavan/branch-exercise.git
	
	this is how you connect your local repository to a cloud repository

$ git remote -v
	origin	git@github.com:katpavan/branch-exercise.git (fetch)
	origin	git@github.com:katpavan/branch-exercise.git (push)

		this is what it would look like if you did connect it

$ git remote remove origin
	
	this is how you remove the connection
