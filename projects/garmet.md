## 6/4/19: 

#### Summary 
* Need to scrape the entirety of Nordstrom and Madewell to deploy useable product.
* Need to fix parsing logic so that all prices are integers
* Update filter to have use multiple fields
* Find a way to intermittently scrape while deployed

#### Thoughts: 
* Today was pretty tough because I had held off on Garmet for a while.  There are many aspects of the projects that will be too difficult to complete by myself and work on job interviews at the same time.  I need to figure out how to scraped intermittently as well as scrape websites that have security measures again automated headless browsers.

* Today though, I think I made good progress.  I scraped about 90% of all the Madewell products and about 2k of the Nordstorm.  There are still a few bugs in the in the front end such as pagination and responsiveness.  I'm still considering if I should implement user profiles so that the like button can have some functionality.
