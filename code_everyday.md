   * Useful code block - Each digit of a number
   ```javascript
   const digitOfInt = (num) => {
    if (num === 0) return false;
    let curr = num;
    while (curr > 1) {
        let digit = Math.floor(curr % 10); 
        console.log(digit);

#### Intro to Computer Science (1-5)

* 1.1 The Universal Machine
  * **Computer:**  a machine that stores and manipulate information under the control of a changeable program.
  * **Computer Program:** a detailed, step-by-step set of instructions telling a computer exactly what to do

* 1.2 Program Power
  * Programming develops the skill to analyze complex systems by reducing them into interactions of understandable subsystems

* 1.3 What is Computer Science?
  * The fundamental question of computer science is: _What can be computed?_
  * The three main techniques investigating this questions are: _design, analysis,_ and _experimentation_
  * **Algorithm:** a step-by-step process for achieving a desired result.
    * Some problems are not solvable by _any_ algorithm.  This is why mathematical _analysis_ of a problem is also use.
    * **Intractable Algorithms:** an algorithm that takes too long or requires too much memory to be of practical value.

* 1.4 Hardware Basics
  * **CPU:** central processing unit, the "brain" of the computer.  This is where all the basic operations of the computer is carried out.
  * **Main Memory (RAM or _Random Access Memory_):** The memory stores programs and data.  The CPU can only directly access information that is store in main memory.  Fast, but is volatile: _When the computer turns off, the memory is lost._  There must be a secondary memory that provides permanent storage.
  * **Hard Drive:** Is the secondary memory.
