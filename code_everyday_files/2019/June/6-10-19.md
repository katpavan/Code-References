## System Design - Google Docs System Design (Operational Transformation)

### Summary : Design a collaborative editing application.  Multiple users can work concurrently on the same document.  The document type can be anything.

### Option 1 - Lock (Pessimistic Concurrency Control)
  * Write permissions is sequentially handed off from user to user.
  * This is **NOT** a good solution because having a large a mount of concurrently users and only one write permission at a time is extremely inefficient.
  * A better solution would be an **Optimistic Concurrency Control** architecture.
  
### Option 2 - **Optimistic Concurrency Control**
  * Example: User A and user B are both working on the same document at the same time.  What is a good method to _sync_ this document up for both users? Words typed by user A can be seen by user B and vice versa.
    1. **(Event Passing) Letter Syncing**
      * As soon as a user types a key, an event fires for that change.
    2. **Line Syncing**
      * As soon as a line is
    3. **Diff Syncing**
