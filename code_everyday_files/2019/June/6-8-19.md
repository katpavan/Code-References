    * This problem is a little strange.  I don't understand why the output would be an array when it should really be an object.
    * How I would solve it with an object would be to create a key for every ingredient and append the dish name to that key everytime it occurs.  Then iterate through the hash and only return ingredients that have a value.length that is greater than 2.
