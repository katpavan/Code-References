    * This problem is a little strange.  I don't understand why the output would be an array when it should really be an object.

    * How I would solve it with an object would be to create a key for every ingredient and append the dish name to that key everytime it occurs.  Then iterate through the hash and only return ingredients that have a value.length that is greater than 2.

    * **Lexicographical order:** Ordered alphabetically. There is a javascript method called [`.sort`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) that will return an array with all the values sorted.

    * Almost correct solution:
        ```javascript
            function groupingDishes(dishes) {
                const ingredientHash = {}
                const result = []
                for(let i in dishes){
                    for(let j = 1; j<dishes[i].length;j++){
                        if(ingredientHash[dishes[i][j]]){
                            ingredientHash[dishes[i][j]].push(dishes[i][0]);
                        }else{
                            ingredientHash[dishes[i][j]] = [dishes[i][0]];
                        }
                    }
                }
                
                //for(let i in ingredientHash){
                //    if(ingredientHash[i].length >= 2){
                //        result.push([i,ingredientHash[i].sort()]);
                //    }
                //}

                for(let i in ingredientHash){
                    if(ingredientHash[i].length >= 2){
                        ingredientHash[i].sort().unshift(i)]
                        result.push(ingredientHash[i]);
                    }
                }    
                
                console.log(ingredientHash)
                return result.sort()
            }
        ```
        * The only incorrect aspect of this solution is that I am returning the dishes of each ingredient inside an array. To solve this, I just `unshifted` the key into its own value.  This essentially breaks the hash but it returns the correctly formatted result.

        * The solution fails two test cases. These two cases have inputs that are extremely large.  This failure is probably a run time timeout.  I need a more optimal solution.
