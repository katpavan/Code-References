### Designing Data-Intensive Aplications (1-7)

* Chapter 1 - Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications
    * Applications today are _data-intensive_, as opposed to _computer-intensive_
        - Raw CPU power is rarely a limiting factor for thie applications
        - Bigger probems are usually the amount of data, the complexity of data, and the speed at which it is changing
    * A data-intensive application is typically builyt from standard building blocks that provide commonly needed functionality
        1. **Databases:** store data so that they, or another application, can find it again
        2. **Caches:** remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed up reads
        3. **Search Indexes:** allow users to search data by keywords or filters
        4. **Stream Processing:** send a message to anohter process, to be handled asynchronously
        5. **Batch Processing:** periodicaly crunch a large amount of accumulated data
    
    * Thinking About Data Systems
        * Many new tools for data stroage and processing have emerged in recent years.  Since they are optimized for a variety of different use cases, they no longer neatly fit into traditional categories.
            - **Redis:** datastores that are also used a message queues
            - **Apache Kafka:** message queues with database-like durability guarantees
        * Modern applications have wide-ranging requirements that a single tool can no longer meet all of its data processing and storage needs.
            - Instead, the work is broken down into tasks that can be performed efficiently on a single tool
            - Those tools are stitched together using application code
